Data
Grey scale images– 2D array of char (anything x anything)
Crop – string
Continue or exit – char
Brightness and dim – an array of string or array of chars 
Load – chars
Files pointers
ACTION
User is prompted in a menu if they would like to upload and image or take it from a file. User they see the image in the file. User is then prompted with another menu in which they could then choose to dim which gives characters a lower value or with brightness which would change the value of the char to a stronger value making the image brighter. The user could also choose to clip the image as well which would then subtract some of the char characters. It should then display, and this process should repeat itself. After whatever they input the user should be able to save and continue to use these 3 options until they want to exit.


FUNCTIONS
Main()
DATA: array to load the image, variables for crop, dim, bright etc
Functionality: load the image, display image, where crop, bright and dim version will display. Will update the image and store values in which the user should be able to realize that it is being saved.

Functionality: load the image, display image, where crop, bright and dim version will display. Will update the image and store values in which the user should be able to realize that it is being saved.
Menu()
Input parameters: char choice, file pointer
Return output: NONE
Functionality: will prompt the user if they would like to load and image or upload an image, then they would then choose if they wanted to display the image or alter the image in which they should be able to then choose if they want to then crop, dim, or brighten the image. Should also be a way for the user to exit as well
Load()
Input parameters (File pointer, char col, char rows)
Returned output: none
Functionality: To take an image from a file and store it in a place where we could then choose what we want to do with it. It should also have and option in which the user himself can choose if they want to keep that image or find a new image in which they would be able to use themselves.

Dim()
Input parameters: File pointer, char rows, char col, char 2d array dim, 
Returned output; char dim

Functionality: This is supposed to take the char characters and display them with a lower value than what the current characters were doing giving it a lighter look that nor


Brighten()
Input parameters: File pointer, char rows, char col, char 2d array bright,
Returned output: some type of char 
Functionality: It supposed to take the char characters and give it and a larger value in char characters so that the image itself is brighter in the display function
Crop()
Input parameters: char rows, char col, char 2d array subtract
Return : none
Functionality: It will go through the array columns and rows and subtract and increment that will alter and control the state of the grey scale image. But it will not be done without asking the user how much they would like to crop from the image. It should then take those values and then store them, so they are ready to be displayed.

Display()
Input parameters: File pointer, char rows, char col, char 2d array display
Return output: 2D array
Functionality: to take the image and store it into the columns rows and take the char images and display them back to the user so the user can see the image and see what they would want to alter and change to their liking
